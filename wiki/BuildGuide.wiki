#summary guide for building adbcj

= ADBCJ Build Guide =

To build ADBCJ, first checkout the code from subversion

{{{
svn checkout http://adbcj.googlecode.com/svn/adbcj/trunk adbcj
}}}

Part of the ADBCJ build includes running a suite of compatibility tests against a MySQL database and a Postgresql database.  The tests will currently connect to the database 'adbcjtck' on 'localhost' with the username 'adbcjtck' and the password 'adbcjtck'.

Once you've created these users for each database environment, you must then import the test schema for each database.  The test schemas are located at:

[http://code.google.com/p/adbcj/source/browse/adbcj/trunk/tck/src/schema/sql/mysql.sql tck/src/schema/sql/mysql.sql]

and

[http://code.google.com/p/adbcj/source/browse/adbcj/trunk/tck/src/schema/sql/postgresql.sql tck/src/schema/sql/postgresql.sql]

Once these schema files have been imported into the respective databases, you should be able to run the ADBCJ build using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven 2] doing:

{{{
mvn install
}}}
